# SelfLearningWikipediaChatbot
A simple bot that webscrapes wikipedia for information on your topic of choice and prints the information for you

Warning: the information the bot returns is a bit iffy depending on how information on the wikipedia page is formatted. Sometimes it will return all the information, other times not so much
